<h1>The Best Movie According to Hanhan</h1>
<h2>My Top3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Lean on Pete</h3>
<p>I love its delicacy, portrait of nature, and the bond between a boy and his favourite racehorse.</p>
<h3>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</h3>
<p>Love the power balance between artists and their muses.</p>
<h3>ChungKing Express</h3>
<p>Used to be my favourite as this is the movie that made me fall in love with Wong Kar Wai.</p>
